# Writing JSX

## Learning Goals

- Understand what JSX is used for
- Identify JSX syntax
- Understand what is required to write valid JSX code

## What is JSX?

JSX allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files. JSX is a syntax
extension of JavaScript that creates a very special and extremely productive
marriage between HTML and JS. It's short for [JavaScript XML][js xml], and was
created by Facebook to work hand-in-hand with React.

With JSX, we can instruct React to create DOM elements in JavaScript in an
efficient and expressive manner. Ultimately, JSX looks a lot like the end result
we see in the browser (i.e. HTML), and is _much_ faster to write compared to
creating DOM elements using something like `document.createElement()`,
especially when incorporating a lot of JavaScript and dynamic content.

## Imperative vs Declarative Programming

JSX uses what is referred to as a _declarative_ style of programming, whereas
creating DOM elements using "vanilla" JavaScript methods like
`document.createElement` would be considered _imperative_.

To write imperative code is to write code that describes _how_ something is done
in detail. To write declarative code is to write _what_ you would like to do.

To further explain, imagine you walk into a local restaurant with the intention
of ordering a sandwich.

- To order **declaratively** would be to say something like this: "I would like
  one toasted ham and cheese sandwich." Rather than worry about the details, you
  are just saying _what_ you want and letting the restaurant staff handle the
  details.
- To order **imperatively** would mean saying something like this instead: "I
  would like you to take three slices of ham, two slices of cheese and a jar of
  mayonnaise from the refrigerator and place them together on a clean counter.
  Please also find two slices of bread. Stack the ham, cheese and bread in this
  order: bread, ham, ham, ham, cheese, cheese, bread. Remove the top slice of
  bread and apply a dollop of mayo. Replace top slice of bread and place
  completed sandwich in oven at 300 degrees for five minutes, then bring it to
  me on a plate."

In general (and to the relief of restaurant staff everywhere), we prefer the
declarative approach when speaking unless we are specifically instructing
someone else.

Creating DOM elements using "vanilla" JavaScript is considered **imperative**
because we write code for each step explicitly. In plain JavaScript, to render a
`div` element on the page, we might end up writing something like:

```js
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.id = "card1";
div.className = "card";
div.textContent = "hello world";
document.body.appendChild(div);
```

Five distinct steps are used here. With JSX, however, we just need to write
_what_ we want, and allow React to figure things out behind the scenes:

```jsx
const div = (
  <div id="card1" className="card">
    hello world
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(div, document.body);
```

Both of the examples above will produce a `<div>` element with the appropriate
class, id, and text content, but the JSX example is significantly cleaner.

How does this work under the hood? The JSX code above isn't valid JavaScript
(JSX is a _syntax extension_, not part of the language), so an intermediate step
needs to happen before React can run our code.

When we run this code through Babel (used with React), Babel sees this and
understands it to be JSX, **not HTML**. Babel can then **transpile** this code
into valid JavaScript, which instructs React how to create this element:

```js
const div = React.createElement(
  "div",
  {
    id: "card1",
    className: "card",
  },
  "hello world"
);

ReactDOM.render(div, document.body);
```

React's `createElement` method then takes the parameters provided and creates
the actual DOM elements, using similar vanilla JavaScript methods like
`document.createElement` under the hood.

While the exact details of how it creates the DOM element differ from
traditional DOM manipulation, the end result is the same: a `div` element added
to the page with the text 'hello world' inside.

## What JSX Looks Like

React components return JSX:

```jsx
function Tweet() {
  const currentTime = new Date().toString();

  // this returns JSX!
  return (
    <div className="tweet">
      <img src="http://twitter.com/some-avatar.png" className="tweet__avatar" />
      <div className="tweet__body">
        <p>We are writing this tweet in JSX. Holy moly!</p>
        <p>{Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)} retweets </p>
        <p>{currentTime}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Whoa, isn't this interesting? It's HTML, but in our JavaScript... with
JavaScript _inside the HTML!_ Looking at this code, there are some important
things to point out:

### JSX is _not_ a String

The JSX in the example is not wrapped in quotes. Think of it as another type in
JavaScript. **We are not interpolating HTML strings** like we do with
`innerHTML`.

### JSX is the Return Value of a Function Component

A function component **must return JSX**.

Every function component you use needs to return _one_ JSX element. Although our
example displays eight lines of JSX, this is done for readability only. The
entire return statement is wrapped in parentheses so it is considered one
'chunk' of JSX code, with _one_ top level element:

```jsx
return <div className="tweet">{/*child elements in here*/}</div>;
```

### JSX Can Include JavaScript

While writing our pseudo-HTML in JSX, we can also write vanilla JavaScript
_in-line_. We do this by wrapping the JavaScript code in **curly braces**.

```jsx
<p>{ Math.floor(Math.random()*100) } retweets</p>
<p>{ currentTime }</p>
```

In the example, we call the `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` methods directly,
which will return a random number when the component is rendered.

We _also_ used a variable, `currentTime`, which holds the String value of the
current date and time. In our example, `currentTime` is a variable within the
`Tweet` component. It's common to write variables inside React components in
order to organize functionality based on a component's responsibility.

This is similar to how we use curly braces when interpolating variables into
strings:

```js
const myString = `The temperature today is ${getTemperature()}`;
```

In both JSX and string interpolation, curly braces are an "escape hatch" in the
syntax. Curly braces allow us to use variables/functions within the JSX to make
our templates dynamic.

**Keep this in mind**: Any time you want to use JavaScript variables or call
functions from within a JSX element, **you must use curly braces** like we did
in the example above.

### JSX Works With Expressions, Not Statements

JSX is an extension of JavaScript, wrapping a lot of underlying function calls
in a syntactically appealing style. This is why JSX code is considered
_declarative_. When _we're_ writing in JSX, it is equivalent to saying "Make an
h1 element with this content inside" and letting React work on the element
creation and function calls. Because we follow the proper syntax, React knows
that when we write:

```jsx
<h1 id="header">Hello!</h1>
```

Babel must convert this JSX into regular, imperative JavaScript before React
renders the component:

```js
React.createElement("h1", { id: "header" }, "Hello!");
```

Which is then committed to the actual DOM as an `h1` DOM node. We never need to
see this â€” all _we_ write is the JSX:

```jsx
<h1 id="header">Hello!</h1>
```

In order for our JSX to be converted into regular JavaScript, the JSX we write
[must be in the form of an **expression**, not a
**statement**][expressions vs statements]. For instance, the following `if`
**statement** is not valid in JSX:

```jsx
<h1 id="header">{if (true) {
  "Hello"
} else {
  "Goodbye"
}}</h1>
```

However, the ternary **expression** does work:

```jsx
<h1 id="header">{true ? "Hello" : "Goodbye"}</h1>
```

The reason for this is that statements don't have a return value, and
expressions do.

You can also call functions from within JSX, if you need to express your code
with an `if` statement:

```jsx
function Header() {
  function getHeaderText(isHello) {
    if (isHello) {
      return "Hello";
    } else {
      return "Goodbye";
    }
  }

  return <h1 id="header">{getHeaderText(true)}</h1>;
}
```

### A Component Can Render Another Component Using JSX

If we have a component (a function that returns JSX), like this:

```jsx
function Header() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

We can embed that component inside another component using JSX:

```jsx
function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <p>Some great content in here</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When we're writing _HTML elements_ in JSX, the element names must be all
_lowercase_, just like we typically write normal HTML elements. When we're
writing _components_ in JSX, the name of the component must be _capitalized_.
This is how React can differentiate our `<Header>` component from a normal HTML
`<header>` element.

### A Component Must Return One JSX Element

In all the lesson examples we've seen so far, each component is returning a
`div` that contains content or child elements. However, we can actually use any
HTML element we would normally use to contain content. The following are all
valid components:

```jsx
function PlainDiv() {
  return <div>I am one line, so I do not need the parentheses</div>;
}

const Photo = () => {
  return (
    <figure>
      <img
        className="image"
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard-learn/sunglasses.gif"
      />
      <figcaption>Whoa</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};

const Table = () => (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>312213</th>
      <th>Tim Berners-Lee</th>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <main>
      <PlainDiv />
      <Photo />
      <Table />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Each of these are valid components, but _all_ of these components have _one_
returned JSX element that contains everything else. Without an element that
wraps the returned JSX in a component, we will get an error.

If you want a component to return multiple JSX elements that aren't wrapped in a
containing DOM element, [React fragments][frag] can help with that.

## JSX Property Names

You may have noticed that property names in JSX don't match exactly with the
property names you're used to from HTML. For example, in JSX, we should use
`className` instead of `class`, and `htmlFor` instead of `for`. If you're
curious why, [check out this writeup from Dan Abramov][classname vs class] and
the discussion from the React community. For a full list of the differences,
have a look at the [React docs on DOM Elements][elements in react].

## Conclusion

In the early forms of React, instead of JSX, components returned JavaScript that
was much less reader friendly. To create a React element, we would write things
like this:

```js
React.createElement("h1", { className: "greeting" }, "Hello, world!");
```

While JSX introduces some new rules we must follow, the benefit is that we can
write code that is semantic and _declarative_. Writing this:

```jsx
<h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>
```

... is just much more pleasant. When we're building complex applications, where
components can be children of other components, JSX provides a critical boost to
readability.

Ultimately, all the JSX code we write will get compiled down to standard
JavaScript and turn into things like `React.createElement` thanks to Babel.
